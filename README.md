## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flowforge.git
cd flowforge
```

---

### 2️⃣ Setup Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

👉 Runs on: http://localhost:3000

---

### 3️⃣ Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

👉 Runs on: http://localhost:5000

---

### 4️⃣ Environment Variables

## Deploying On Vercel

For Vercel, the deployable Next.js app lives in `frontend/`.

Two supported setups:

1. Import the repository in Vercel and set the **Root Directory** to `frontend`.
2. Deploy the repository root with the included root `package.json` and `vercel.json`, which forward the build to the frontend workspace.

If your existing Vercel project was imported from the repository root and shows a 404, update the project's **Root Directory** to `frontend` or redeploy after pulling these config changes.
